# Task Description

*Provide a full description of the task here.*

Create a 6cm*6cm*6cm cube of mass 200g. (Note – You should apply physics). Place a distance sensor at the middle of a face of the cube. Range of the sensor is 20cm-400cm. Box will be placed on a flat surface of a robot with 3600 view angles. Robot will revolve around its axis at a fixed angular velocity

If there is an object infront of the sensor, then the distance has to be recorded. After completion of one round program should output the objects number in descending order distances. (Note – number of pillars are more than one and two pillars will not be kept at same distance. Robot does not stop revolving after one cycle. Program should identify the completion of one round. Objects detected out of the range can be neglected.)

Sample test case – There are 3 pillars placed at distances 50cm, 100.5cm and 500cm from the axis of the robot. You should output “object 3, object 2, object 1” at the completion of exactly one revolve.

* Evaluation test case – There are 5 pillars placed at distances 45cm, 60 cm, 100 cm 40cm 350cm. Output should be “object 5, object 3, object 2, object 1, object 4”
* Evaluation test case – There are 3 pillars placed at distances 90cm, 600cm 95cm. Output should be “object 3, object 1”
* Evaluation test case – There are 5 pillars placed at distances 55cm, 25cm, 12cm, 15cm, 17cm. Output should be “object 1”
* Evaluation test case – There are 3 pillars placed at distances 85cm, 390cm and 420cm. Output should be “object 2, object 1”
* Evaluation test case – There are 3 pillars placed at distances 105cm, 50 cm, 600cm. Output should be “object 1, object 2”
